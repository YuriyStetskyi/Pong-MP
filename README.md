# Pong multiplayer game by Yuriy Stetskyi

This is unreal engine project, to get only game go to:
https://bitbucket.org/steyur/pong-mp-gamefiles/src/main/

To play the game:
1. Follow the bitbucket link
2. On left side of the screen is "Downloads" section
3. In that section there will be "Download repository" button
4. Unpack downloaded .zip file
5. Open Pong_MP.exe and allow Unreal Engine to install needed packages after which game will be playable

----------------------------------------------------------------------

reason for storing game on bitbucket is 
github doesn't support uploading files larger than 100 MB
and the game has files bigger than 100 MB

in future projects installer will be made, or Git LFS used
